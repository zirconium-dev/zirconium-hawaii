# Zirconium Hawaii

Zirconium, but based on [Freedesktop SDK](https://gitlab.com/freedesktop-sdk/freedesktop-sdk) instead of Fedora.

## What is Zirconium Hawaii

Zirconium Hawaii is an experiment (initially known as Niri OS) that turned into a real project. It is a distribution that builds its own components in a manner that is both far closer to the source, and is 100% reproducible.

Zirconium Hawaii can be compared most accurately to [Gnome OS](https://os.gnome.org), which is our biggest inspiration for this project. We use the same build system as Gnome OS, and we even use components **from** Gnome OS!

## How do I use this?

Currently, there isn't an official installation method. Rebasing from Zirconium (Fedora) to Zirconium Hawaii *has* been done successfully, but it is not officially supported, and **will** give you strange issues.
